sub(pattern, replacement, x)
gsub(pattern, replacement, x)

Replace the first occurrence of a pattern with sub or replace all occurrences with gsub.
pattern – A pattern to search for, which is assumed to be a regular expression. Use an additional argument fixed=TRUE to look for a pattern without using regular expressions.
replacement – A character string to replace the occurrence (or occurrences for gsub) of pattern.

x – A character vector to search for pattern. Each element will be searched separately.

x <- c("This is a sentence about axis", "A second pattern is also listed here")

> sub("is", "XY", x)
[1] "ThXY is a sentence about axis"       
[2] "A second pattern XY also listed here"

> gsub("is", "XY", x)
[1] "ThXY XY a sentence about axXY"       
[2] "A second pattern XY also lXYted here"
